<h1>OS101</h1>

Thisis is my first attempt to build a "modern" operating system

<b>!!!You wanna understand something? Build it!!!</b>

<h4>Getting started<h4>

<h3>Requirements<h3><br>
    - qemu-system-x86_64 

<h3>Build and Run<h3><br>
this will build the project and run it with the suggested qemu flags

```sh
git clone https://github.com/leulshawel/OS101
make run
```
you can also try this to just build the image file

```sh
make os.img
```
